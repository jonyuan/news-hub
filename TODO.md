# General Notes

## Architecture

We currently follow a "component-lite" [architecture](https://ratatui.rs/concepts/application-patterns/component-architecture/). Looking to move towards an event-bus architecture to self-contain components vis a vis an [Elm](https://ratatui.rs/concepts/application-patterns/the-elm-architecture/)/[Flux](https://ratatui.rs/concepts/application-patterns/flux-architecture/) pattern

# Issues

# Todo List

- configure a more useful status bar

## 11.24.25
